+++++++++++Activity Details in List+++++++++++
- Break down details into own components

1. Create file ActivityListItem.tsx
- src/features/activities/dashboard/ActivityListItem.tsx

2. Copy code from ActivityList to ActivityListItem
return (
    <Item key={activity.id}>
      ...
    </Item>
  );

!! Fix missing imports

3. Remove Delete Button (Delete was for exercise purposes only)

4. Pass in Activity from ActivityList
- pass in a key
{activitiesByDate.map(activity => (
    <ActivityListItem key={activity.id} activity={activity} />
))}

5. Catch in ActivityList
- We do not need and IProps, we can import type IActivity and then set the Type parameter as a destructured Props
...
import { IActivity } from "../../../app/models/activity";
...
const ActivityListItem: React.FC<{ activity: IActivity }> = ({ activity }) => {
...
